<!-- REFLECTION: 

1. A challenge that I faced was using an image as my background. I used chatGPT as a refresher but then decided to just go with a plain black background. Another challenge I faced were spacing issues with my grid container. Its been a while since I've used grid so I referenced a previous project hat I had worked on for a refresher. Other than that I found it surpisingly easy because jquery did all the work haha. 

2. Is it ethical to copy and paste from online sources? Yes and no. I dont know if there is a set of rules from copy and pasting AI generated code. Will OpenAI decide to hit everyone with a massive copyright lawsuit one day? I dont know. I'm not sure what the rules are with that. As far as copy and pasting someone elses original work, I would say that is unethical. (Although they probably copy and pasted their code from somewhere else too.) Shoutout to all the real engineers who wrote code before stackoverflow and AI tools. But if you are using code from someone elses project I would say its appropriate to cite that source or obtain permission.

3. Ive leared first hand that AI can make mistakes. So it cant do everything for you. Also, I still find it important to know how the code works, especially as a project grows in size. Reverse engineering code is still an invaluable skill I beleive. AI can help you with a general idea but knowing how to troubeleshoot and customize code is very important. One of my favorite quotes is "all devs us google, senior devs just know WHAT to google" and that concept also applies to using code generating tools. I look at chatGPT like a glorified google search engine. It just helps you find answers faster. Copy and pasting is easy but there is a skill of knowing where to paste. Then when you get into code structure and project architecture thats a whole other ball game. There is still massive value behind being skilled with vanilla javascript.  -->
